# MERN Authentication Project ðŸŒŸ

This is my first project implementing user authentication using the MERN stack! ðŸš€  

## Features  
- User login and registration ðŸ”’  
- Secure authentication with **JWT** (JSON Web Token)  
- State management with **Redux Toolkit**  
- Backend powered by **Express.js** and **MongoDB**  
- Frontend built using **React.js**  

## Tech Stack  
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user information  
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for creating API routes  
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces  
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for backend development  

## How It Works  
1. **User Registration**: Create an account securely  
2. **User Login**: Authenticate using JWT and manage sessions with cookies  
3. **Dashboard**: Protected routes accessible only to logged-in users

This project was a great learning experience, helping me dive into the MERN stack and explore secure authentication techniques. ðŸŒŸ
